# fft
A fast file transfer application built using C++ and sockets, supporting both server and client functionalities for quick and efficient file transmission over a network 
i made this because i always face issues when i try to transfer a file from windows to my linux box , specially in CTFS where i try to open a smb share and make a whole big process,
which could be dangerous sometimes if you try to close the server or for example you make a GUEST LOGIN ENABLED thats why i created this lightweight console application

USAGE:

./server 127.0.0.1 443

./client 127.0.0.1 443 /path/to/your/file.txt
